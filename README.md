# Coursera Course "Getting and Cleaning Data" - Course Project

## Content

- an R-script called "run_analysis.R": This script reads the relevant files, merges them, extracts the relevant info, renames columns and variables to a readable format, and saves a tidy dataset
- a codebook called "codebook.md": The codebook describes the data and the steps that transform the input data to the final tidy dataset.
- the final tidy dataset called "tidydata.txt"

## Dataset for assignment

When running the script run_alaysis.R, the necessary datasets are automatically downloaded and unzipped from https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip
